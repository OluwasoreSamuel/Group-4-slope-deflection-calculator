This project is a Structural Analysis Tool designed to solve indeterminate beams and frames using the slope deflection method. The slope deflection method is a powerful technique in structural engineering for analyzing and determining internal forces and deformations in statically indeterminate structures.

## Expected Features
- **Interactive Input:** Allows users to input beam and frame properties, support conditions and loads interactively.

- **Slope Deflection Analysis:** Utilizes the slope deflection method to analyze and solve statically indeterminate beams and frames.

- **Visual Representation:** Generates visual representations of the analyzed structure, including bending moment diagrams and shear force diagrams.
